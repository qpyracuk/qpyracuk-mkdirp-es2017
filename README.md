# @qpyracuk/mkdirp-es2017

This is a complete copy of the [mkdirp](https://github.com/isaacs/node-mkdirp) library version 3.0.1, recompiled for an older version of nodejs (nodejs 8+ | ES2017).

## Installation

This is a JS library available through the npm registry.
Before installation, you need to download and install `Node.js`.
Requires `Node.js v8.0.0 or higher`.

If this is a completely new project, be sure to create a `package.json` file using the npm init command.

To install the package, enter the `npm install @qpyracuk/mkdirp-es2017` command in the console.

```sh
npm install @qpyracuk/mkdirp-es2017

## Documentation

You can find documentation for this library on the official page of [this package](https://github.com/isaacs/node-mkdirp).

## Gratitude

I express my deep gratitude to the developers of the mkdirp library. Your work is excellent, but unfortunately it does not run under nodejs 8.
